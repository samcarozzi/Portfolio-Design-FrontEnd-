#🎨 Sam’s Designs | 🖼️ UI/UX  

Welcome to my Design Portfolio Repository! Here, I’ve gathered my work in UI/UX design, focusing on two major projects: the MuseScore Plugin Demo and Teams for Tech Fellowship Frontend Designs. Here are my interactive prototypes, Figma layouts, and frontend design elements. ✨  

##🎶 MuseScore Plugin Demo 🎶  | AI Meets Music in a User-Friendly Plugin
🎧 This plugin prototype is built to make AI-driven music composition accessible for all, designed with musicians in mind. My backend is also accessible here: [AI-UX Research at GT](https://github.com/samcarozzi/AI-UX-Research-at-GT)
