# 🎨 Sam’s Designs | 🖼️ UI/UX  

Welcome to my Design Portfolio Repository! Here, I’ve gathered my work in UI/UX design, focusing on two major projects: the MuseScore Plugin Demo and Teams for Tech Fellowship Frontend Designs. Here are my interactive prototypes, Figma layouts, and frontend design elements. ✨  

## 🎶 MuseScore Plugin Demo 🎶  | AI Meets Music in a User-Friendly Plugin
🎧 This plugin prototype is built to make AI-driven music composition accessible for all, designed with musicians in mind. My backend is also accessible here: [AI-UX Research at GT](https://github.com/samcarozzi/AI-UX-Research-at-GT)  

### 🌟 Highlights  
#### 🎹 Interactive Figma Prototype: [MuseScore Plugin](https://www.figma.com/proto/YA6suOnJNpZndLPqTdHAuc/Musecore-Plugin-Demo?node-id=0-1&t=NNrIqGZz8cuoz4FK-1) – crafted for an immersive, musical experience 🎼  
#### 🎶 QML Frontend Execution: [Plugin Demo](https://youtu.be/BVKo3CmO0EI?si=eJFMOHZr5Za3jClF) - Creating a seamless UI that feels like second nature to musicians  

## 🐝 Teams for Tech Fellowship 🐝 

As part of Georgia Tech’s Teams for Tech Fellowship, I designed and developed UI/UX solutions to improve campus services with interactive Figma prototypes and Dart frontend development. 🌐  

### 🌟 Highlights  
#### 🖥️ Figma Prototypes: Mockups designed to simplify user interaction for students

## Data Visualization🌱🌱

I modeled hundreds of thousands of reactions on Excel as part of high-performance computing research focused on environmental sustainability. This experience involved extensive data analysis and optimization, showcasing my skills in managing complex datasets and leveraging computational techniques.
